Things to do for this project:

- URGENT Implement negated constraints because of prohibitions, completely bugged!!!!

Things to discuss in conference call with everyone:

- Decide when/how the norm update should take place:
  * Through the belief revision function, all at once?
  * Through an AgentSpeak level action allowing plans to decide when to ignore
    norms
  
- Decide when/how to resolve norm conflicts - Nir writing a paragraph on possible problematic case
  * At instantiation
  * At norm addition 

- Should we force specific norms to be fully ground?
  * Why yes and why no (discuss reasons for each) - Not forcing is the key
  
- When/how should we annotate plans 
  * at norm update and annotate with the restrictions from specific norms ****
  * at norm update and annotate with the restrictions from abstract norms 
    (we will need something to switch specific annotations on and off)
  * at norm addition and annotate with the restrictions from abstract norms
    (again, we have the issue of when to switch specific restrictions on and off)
    
- Again about plan annotations
  * When we compose plan annotations (such as when we collect annotations in a plan)
    should we check if the composition is itself satisfiable?
    (Maybe we can detect other types of conflict)

- When is the best time to add the norms to an agent?
  * As an action in Plan Library space
    (Advantages include being able to specify provenance acceptability in the 
     agent language, e.g. if the norm comes from agent X, ignore it)
  * As an addendum to the belief revision process in Java-space

- Norm removal
  * How should we do norm removal, do we even talk about it? 
  * How this affects running intentions? 
  * Should we keep abiding by the norm even after it has been removed
