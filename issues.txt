Known Issues

- Constraint Satisfaction
  * The Jason-based implementation works only when the constraint being checked
    becomes fully ground given the unifier used to instantiate the plan.
    In effect this is merely checking if the constraint formula holds for the
    specific unifier, and the constraint becomes an extended context condition.
  
  * The Cream and JaCoP constraint satisfaction do not fully work, as a result
    of an incomplete translation of a formula into the specific library calls.
    There is always the issue of dealing with variable types.
    Whereas integer variables are easy to translate into constraint problems 
    for these libraries, logic ones are not so straightforward, as we need to
    map them into Finite Domain Variables, with a potential domain of the 
    entire Herbrand Base of the agent specification.
